6/20: Currently working on app ideas for a fullstack Nextjs application (need to discuss with Baseem). Reviewing React and learning Next.js -- working on a sample dashboard app tutorial https://github.com/dangabrielle/dashboard-app-nextjs. Update: decided to start setting up the backend (express server with Node, and postgresQL integration), intially attempted to install openTAK server but it does not have documentation for macOS.
